**Q2** More discussion on the special multi-agent properties (uncommon for single-agent RL) in the safety problem would be appreciated. For example, what if agent A is caused harm by agent B, rather than itself?

> **A2** Indeed, our theory is developed so that the agent can recover from its harm by itself. In the above-described scenario, our methods would make agent A escape the dangerous situation and find an alternative behaviour. It is most likely, however, that in such a situation agent B is at risk too (e.g., when two cars crash). Thus, both agents would alter their actions to reach safety. In multi-agent settings, each agent needs to consider each other safety and reward, in single-agent settings, the ego agent just needs to consider itself reward and safety. For example, in our problem formulation,  although the action $a_t^i$ of agent $i$ does not directly influence the costs $\{C^k_j(s_t, a_t^k)\}_{j=1}^{m^k}$ of other agents $k\neq i$, the action $a^i_t$ will implicitly influence their total costs due to the dependence on the next state $s_{t+1}$. More particularly, the setting of implicit influence is suitable to real-world applications, and this formulation realistically describes multi-agent interactions; an action of an agent has an instantaneous effect on the system only locally, but the rest of the agents may suffer from its consequences at later stages. For example, consider a car that crosses on the red light; although other cars may not be at risk of riding into pedestrians immediately, the induced traffic may cause hazards soon later.
